# text_correction_QUOTATION
This Tampermonkey script customizes the text displayed on the car edit page of the Sal-Sabeel Cars website. Once installed, it automatically changes the target text element to display "OFFER/" in bold on one line and "QUOTATION" on the next. On the source code the spelling of "QUOTATION" was wrong, and this script can edit it without source code.
